Some things to add:
    1) increasing difficulty for every 10 points. Target will decrease by a size of 5px each time.
    2) Have actual textures for the background and the target itself.
    3) Have defined stages.
    4) Add a menu.
    5) Give multiple game modes through the option menu.
        a) Increasing number of targets, goes up to a specific limit. When it hits that limit it is game over.
